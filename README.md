# Enigma
On this project i created an Enigma machine simulator using python code.
During the creation of the Enigma simulator i learned how the original machine works, so iw will be able to imitiate its encryption process.

To understand the project's differnet parts you should know the enigma components:

        1. Substitutor: letter-index conversions, circular shifts, abstract forward and reverse
        translation.
        2. Translator: simple forward and automatically computed reverse permutations.
        3. Reflector: a Translator with symmetric permutation.
        4. Plugboard: similar to Reflector, but converts each pairs specification into its corresponding permutation.
        5. Rotor: letter translation via a single rotor, taking into account ring setting and offset.
        6. Enigma: machine configuration process, complete letter translation, and rotors single and
        double-stepping mechanism

I implemented each and every one of these components, and connected allof them to one Enigma maachine.

Hope you will enjoy this project :)
